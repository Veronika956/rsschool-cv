## About me   

After the graduation from BSEU university, I started my carrier in a Food&Baverages sphere.
While working there I improved my skills of establishing communications, get experience of a team work and realized how important it is to be a team player when you work in a big company.
After 3 years of working in that sphere I managed to become a restaurant manager.
I had a large scale of responsibility, because as a manager I needed to organize everybody's work and to control everything.
I got a lot of experience in time management and become a stress-resistant person.
Everybody told me that I have a brilliant carrier, but I felt that I need something else. I wanted to unleash my potential and challenge myself at the same time. 

Now I work in an IT company as an office manager. I take a course of ios development from the GeekBrains school (I study animation for today). 
I've already accomplished a course for beginners, that included the basics of JS, HTML + CSS and PHP. 
My English level is assessed by a teacher as Upper-Intermediate and I keep practice it twice a week attending the online course.

My goal is to learn swift and then to find a job as a junior IOS developer and I believe that RS course will help me to achieve my goal.
